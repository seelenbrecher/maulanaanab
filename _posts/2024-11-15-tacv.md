Automated claim verification plays an essential role in fostering trust in the digital space. Temporal claim verification brings new challenges where cues of the temporal information need to be extracted, and temporal reasoning involving various temporal aspects of the text must be applied. In this work, we describe an end-to-end solution for temporal claim verification that considers the temporal information in claims to obtain relevant evidence sentences and harnesses the power of a large language model for temporal reasoning. We curate two datasets comprising a diverse range of temporal claims to learn time-sensitive representations that encapsulate not only the semantic relationships among the events, but also their chronological proximity. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly enhances the accuracy of temporal claim verification, thereby advancing current state-of-the-art in automated claim verification.

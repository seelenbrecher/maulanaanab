The AVeriTeC shared task introduces a new real-word claim verification dataset, where a system is tasked to verify a real-world claim based on the evidence found in the internet. In this paper, we proposed a claim verification pipeline called QECV which consists of two modules, Evidence Retrieval and Claim Verification. Our pipeline collects pairs of <Question, Answer> as the evidence. Recognizing the pivotal role of question quality in the evidence efficacy, we proposed question enrichment to enhance the retrieved evidence. Specifically, we adopt three different Question Generation (QG) technique, muti-hop, single-hop, and Fact-checker style. For the claim verification module, we integrate an ensemble of multiple state-of-the-art LLM to enhance its robustness. Experiments show that QECV achieves 0.41, 0.29, and 0.42 on Q, Q+A, and AVeriTeC scores.
